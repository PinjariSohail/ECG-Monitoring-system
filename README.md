# ECG-Monitoring-system

The ECG Monitoring System is a real-time heart activity tracking project designed to aid in remote healthcare monitoring. This system utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller and the AD8232 ECG sensor to capture the electrical activity of the heart (ECG - Electrocardiogram). The AD8232 sensor detects and amplifies the small bioelectrical signals generated by the heart, which are then processed and transmitted by the ESP32. The core objective of this project is to provide a portable, low-cost, and Wi-Fi-enabled system that can be deployed to continuously monitor a patient's cardiac health. By leveraging the powerful processing and connectivity capabilities of the ESP32, the system can efficiently acquire ECG data and transmit it to a cloud-based platform without the need for complex medical infrastructure.

This ECG data is uploaded in real-time to the ThingSpeak cloud platform using the HTTP protocol over Wi-Fi communication. ThingSpeak provides a user-friendly dashboard where caregivers or medical professionals can visualize and analyze the ECG waveform and heart rate remotely. This system can be particularly useful in scenarios such as home care for elderly patients, early diagnosis of cardiac conditions, or telemedicine applications where continuous monitoring is crucial. The real-time data logging also enables historical trend analysis for medical evaluations. This project is a great example of how IoT (Internet of Things) can be integrated with biomedical applications to create smart, connected healthcare systems that improve both accessibility and response time in critical situations.
